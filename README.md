# gcd_euclidean_algorithm
the program returns an integer solution to the equation au + bv = gcd(a,b), a solution to exercise 1.12 of the book An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography by Jeffrey Hoffstein.

# the extended Euclidean algorithm theorem
Let `a` and `b` be positive integers. Then the equation `au + bv = gcd(a,b)` always has `a` solution in integers `u` and `v`.
